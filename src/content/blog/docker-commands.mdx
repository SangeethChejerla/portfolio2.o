## Docker Command Usage Guide

### 0. basic

```
docker build .
docker run -p port:port [image-id]
```

### 1. Building and Managing Docker Images

- **Build a Docker Image**

  ```sh
  docker build -t myapp:latest .
  ```

  Builds a Docker image from the current directory with the tag `myapp:latest`.

- **List Docker Images**

  ```sh
  docker images
  ```

  Lists all available Docker images on your local system.

- **Remove an Image**

  ```sh
  docker rmi [image-id or repository:tag]
  ```

  Removes a specific Docker image by its ID or tag.

- **Prune Unused Images**
  ```sh
  docker image prune -a
  ```
  Removes all unused Docker images to free up space.

### 2. Running and Managing Containers

- **Run a Container**

  ```sh
   docker run -p port:port -d --name [name] name:tag
  ```

  Runs a container from the `myapp:latest` image, mapping port `8080` on the host to port `80` in the container. The container runs in detached mode (`-d`) and is named `myapp-container`.

- **List Running Containers**

  ```sh
  docker ps
  ```

  Lists all currently running Docker containers.

- **List All Containers**

  ```sh
  docker ps -a
  ```

  Lists all Docker containers, including stopped ones.

- **Start a Stopped Container**

  ```sh
  docker start [container-id or name]
   (or)
  docker start -a [image-id]
  ```

  Starts a stopped container named `myapp-container`.

- **Stop a Running Container**

  ```sh
  docker stop [container-id or name]
  ```

  Stops a running container named `myapp-container`.

- **Remove a Stopped Container**
  ```sh
  docker rm [container-id or name]
  ```
  Removes a stopped container named `myapp-container`.

### 3. Executing Commands and Debugging

- **Execute a Command Inside a Running Container**

  ```sh
  docker exec -it myapp-container /bin/bash
  ```

  Opens an interactive terminal (`-it`) inside the running container named `myapp-container`, allowing you to execute commands within it.

- **View Container Logs**

  ```sh
  docker logs [container-id or name]
  ```

  Displays the logs for the container named `myapp-container`.

- **Follow Container Logs**

  ```sh
  docker logs -f [container-id or name]
  ```

  Follows the logs for the container named `myapp-container` in real-time.

- **Attach to a Running Container**
  ```sh
  docker attach [container-id or name]
  ```
  Attaches to the running container's console for live interaction.

### 4. Image and Container Lifecycle Management

- **Push an Image to a Registry**

  ```sh
  docker push myapp:latest
  ```

  Pushes the `myapp:latest` image to a Docker registry.

- **Pull an Image from a Registry**
  ```sh
  docker pull myapp:latest
  ```
  Pulls the `myapp:latest` image from a Docker registry.

### 5. Advanced Usage

- **Run a Container in Interactive Mode**

  ```sh
  docker exec -it [container-id or name] [command]
  ```

  Runs a container from the `myapp:latest` image in interactive mode with a terminal session.

- **Start a Container in Interactive Mode**

  ```sh
  docker start -a -i myapp-container
  ```

  Starts a container named `myapp-container` and attaches to it in interactive mode.

- **Remove Unused Containers and Images**
  ```sh
  docker system prune -a
  ```
  Removes all stopped containers, unused networks, and dangling images, freeing up space.
- ** Inspect a Container**

```
docker inspect [container-id or name]
```
